Dear <homeowner>,

My name is Simone and for years I’ve been looking to purchase a home in <neighborhood>, and your property at <address_street> looks ideal!

For as long as I can remember, I have dreamt of having a nurturing space within a busy urban environment to create a sense of community. 
Friends and family come and go, as we dive into different projects around the property. The space and large bountiful lot is a dream come true.

Your property is perfect for this dream to become a reality, and I can barely contain the excitement this brings up in me! After over three years of searching google maps, redfin, zillow… I have finally found a space that fits my needs.

I am pre approved, and ready to buy, with a generous amount of cash down. So I am reaching out to you to see if you would consider selling your house. I realize this is a bit of an unorthodox request and I apologize if this is too direct. It’s worth a shot (:

Thank you for your time - feel free to call / email me anytime:

Sincerely,
Simone (and Gary)
